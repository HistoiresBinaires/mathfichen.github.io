## About
As of November 2023, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers (CNAM), affiliated with the laboratory [History of Techno-Sciences in Society (HT2S)](https://technique-societe.cnam.fr/histoire-des-technosciences-en-societe-ht2s--913760.kjsp). I received my engineering training at [Mines Paristech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) and Corps des Mines and hold a master's degree in the History and Philosophy of Science from the [University of Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/). I previously worked at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology, with the [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) team, contributing to the team's efforts in building a universal software archive. I am still actively involved with Software Heritage, contributing to the preservation of historical software source code under UNESCO funding.
